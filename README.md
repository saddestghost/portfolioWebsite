## Description
Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
-
-The motivation for this project was to create a professional hub for all of my information, i.e. portfolio, contact info, a little bit about me, etc.
-At the moment it doesn't achieve that much for me, but in the future it should consolidate all of my useful info so I don't have to bounce between all professional networking platforms without having a central website to redirect to. 
-I learned that despite how well you think you understand the material during class, it's a different beast entirely to try and write something from scratch. The hardest part is pushing everything that you know you have to get done to the side, and just write the first line of code.
